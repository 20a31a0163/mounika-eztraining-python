polymorphism:
one item or same item used for different purposes.
types:
1)overloading
a)operater overloading
b)methods overloading
2)over riding:IF a method is defective are cannot 
be used inside derived class it will take 
it from its base class or parent class

                 


                                      DATA STRUCTERS

Helps to write efficient programs 
*linear-array /linkedlist/STACK/QUEUE/MATRIX
*NON LINEAR-BINARY TREE /HEAP/HASH TABLE/GRAPH
LINEAR-storing data seuentially
*nonlinear-no sequentialstyle required

static-array(size increase or decrease)
dynamic-list,stack,queue.

LINKED LIST:real time example-train
as the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list.
TYPES:singly/doubly/circular


##creating link list
1.create the node
2.partisian the node with two segments data and none 
3.add value into the blank node 
4.mark the node as head
5.create the next node by folloeing the above steps now ur nxt step  to be established link b/w the 1st node and 2 nd node
*display linked list
traversalis required for 1 st node till in order to display
