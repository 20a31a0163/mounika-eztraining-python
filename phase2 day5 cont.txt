binary tree:a node have maximum 2 child

binary traversal
1.in order: left-root-right(1rd)
2.pre order:root-left-right (dlr) 
3.post order: left-right-root (lrd)

1.breadth first traversal: 
2.depth first traversal:

#binarytree types:
1. full binarytree:all the nodes will have 0 or 2 children 
2.pathological/degenerate tree:all nodes have 0/1 node
3.skewed binary tree:
*left skewed binary tree
*right skewed binary tree

#complete binary tree:
1.every level should be full or complete
2.in last level if it is incomplete notes should present at extreme keft side

#perfect binary tree:
1.all internal nodes those who have two child and leaf nodes both are at same level
2.balanced binary tree: for all the nodes height of left subtree-height of right subtree can be 0/1 then it is called as balanced binary tree. 
#aspecial tree is called binary search tree.all the left side elements should be lesser then its perent and all right side elements should be greater than its parent.
