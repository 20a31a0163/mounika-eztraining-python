functioon-code reusability
lambda function-its called as ananumous function when we want to use function concept without 
using function name there we apply concept of lambda function



4 pillers of oops
1.abstraction:hiding the implementation part showing what is required for 
the users is called as abstraction ex;exe file
 
2.encapsulation:binding data and function into a single entity
  'a'.public------one class info can be accessed by any other class
  'b'.private-----can used where it is declared/no in inheritected 
  'c'.protected---can be accessed only where it got declared---which ever 
      class inherited from this class there also we can use
3.inharitance:base class and derived class 
   derived class will inherit properties of base class
   base class-parent class
   derived class-child class
**4 types of inharitance
1.single inharitance
2.multiple inharitance
3.multilevel inharitance
4.hierarchical inharitance
5.hybrid inharitance
4.polymorphism
